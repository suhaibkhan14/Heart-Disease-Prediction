## 🏥 Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease can help save lives and reduce treatment costs. This project leverages **machine learning classification algorithms** to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain insights into the dataset.
- 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing**, including handling missing values and normalization.
- 🤖 **Model Training** using algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🎯 **Hyperparameter Tuning** to optimize model performance.
- 🚀 **Deployment** of trained models for real-time predictions.
